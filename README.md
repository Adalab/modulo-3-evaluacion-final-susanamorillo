                                                        Owen Wilson project in React


        Hello, I'm Susana, 
        and here I present the final of my evaluation in Adalab, module 3.
        
The web consists of developing a web page with the list of scenes from the movies where the
Actor Owen Wilson has said 'wow', in this case it consists of 50 scenes.

The entire project is built on React, and for this it has also been necessary to install different dependencies, such as vite, react-router-dom- react uuid, gh pages,...



Here I leave the link of the project http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-susanamorillo/,

Good day
